          <p>The <b>Software & Application Innovation Lab</b> (SAIL) at the <a class='conlink' href="http://www.bu.edu/hic/">Hariri Institute for Computing</a> is a professional software design and development lab that serves as a collaborative resource for computational and data-driven research efforts across Boston University.</p>
          <p>Supported projects focus on a wide range of topics and technologies, from using natural language processing to analyze large literature corpora, to solving record linkage problems for public health and economics applications, to building mobile applications for medical studies, to building smart-city services and platforms.</p>
          <p>SAIL is committed to promoting innovation within the research community and will learn new technologies and techniques as determined by the needs of any given project.</p>

          <p>Across Boston University, the quality and the potential impact of research activities (as well as the success of both students and researchers) are increasingly dependent on the ability to work with data and computational approaches, the development of quality software applications and services, and familiarity with software development practices.</p>
          <p>SAIL has provided consultations, project and budget planning assistance, prototype and software application development, and other forms of support to numerous research efforts funded by the Hariri Research Awards, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and other agencies. SAIL has worked with over 40 clients across 12 schools at Boston University.</p>
