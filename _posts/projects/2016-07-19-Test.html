title: Secure Compensation Analytics for the City of Boston
category: project
---
In support of the Boston Women’s Workforce Council and its mission to advance salary equity among Boston employers as part of the 100% Talent Compact, SAIL staff and student developers built a secure multi-party computation web application that allows statistical data pertaining to compensation levels across genders and demographics to be collected from about 70 participating employer organizations, such as State Street Corporation and Putnam Investments, without requiring any organization to reveal its confidential data. This platform is unique in that it allows real-world organizations to use what is still largely studied as a theoretical technique, enabling analyses that would have been otherwise impossible to do while preserving the confidentiality of the participants.
